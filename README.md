# Prediction-on-California-Housing
For this project I am going to make a prediction on the house price in California districts. The techniques I am going to use are regression and random forest. 
For convenience I chose a dataset called ‘California_housing’ which can be imported directly from Python sklearn package. This dataset contains the information of 20640 blocks of houses within the state of California in 1990. The dataset includes 8 different features of houses which may affect the house price. 
Work to do:
(1)	Import the dataset and observe it.
(2)	Modify some of the data because they have been scaled down for some reason. 
(3)	Split the dataset into a training set and a test set.
(4)	Model training.
(5)	Prediction.
(6)	Evaluate the model.
